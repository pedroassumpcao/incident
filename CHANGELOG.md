## [0.5.1] - 2020-11-03

### Changed

#### Library

- Add `id` for the in memory event data structure;
- Sort events by `id` in the Event Store `Postgres` and `InMemory` adapters to ensure proper event ordering;
- Remove `updated_at` column from `events` table in the `mix incident.postgres.init` task;
- Update documentation;
- Update package dependencies;

#### Bank Example Application

- Update `events` migration to reflect changes in the `mix incident.postgres.init` task;

## [0.5.0] - 2020-10-15

### Added

#### Library

- Add `get/2` for Projection Store `InMemory` and `Postgres` adapters to fetch a projection for a specific
aggregate;

#### Bank Example Application

- Add `Transfer`, `TransferCommandhandler`, `TransferState` and `TransferEventHandler` to
demonstrate an example of **aggregate root** use-case;
- Add examples of events that can generate specific commands in `TransferEventHandler` to
demonstrate sequence of **Event -> Command -> Event** use-cases;

### Changed

#### Library

- The `CommandHandler` now returns `{:ok, persisted_event}` instead of just `:ok`, allowing event
handlers to compose a new command and call the `CommandHandler` based on the previous event. This
allows a series of **Event -> Command -> Event** to be built;
- Set Elixir minimum version to 1.8;
- Update package dependencies;

#### Bank Example Application

- Rename `Bank.EventHandler` to `Bank.BankAccountEventHandler` to make it clear that this
handler is only for the `BankAccount` aggregate events as now we have more than one aggregate;
- Set Elixir minimum version to 1.8;
