# Contribuiting to Incident

:+1::tada: First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1: Here are a few general guidelines on contributing and reporting bugs to Incident that we ask you to take a look first. Notice that all of your interactions in the project are expected to follow our Code of Conduct.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs or Suggesting Enhancements

Before creating bug reports or suggesting enhacements, please check the current [issue list](https://github.com/pedroassumpcao/incident/issues) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. Please include as many details as possible. Fill out [the required template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

### Sending Pull Requests

Before sending a new Pull Request, take a look on existing Pull Requests and Issues
to see if the proposed change or fix has been discussed in the past, or if the
change was already implemented but not yet released.

We expect new Pull Requests to include enough tests for new or changed behavior,
and we aim to maintain everything as most backwards compatible as possible,
reserving breaking changes to be ship in major releases when necessary. There is a [pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) that will help you outline the main points.

If your Pull Request includes new or changed behavior, be sure that the changes
are beneficial to a wide range of use cases or it's an application specific change
that might not be so valuable to other applications.

We also welcome Pull Requests that improve our existing documentation, both our
`README.md` and the in the source code.

Thanks again for your interest on contributing to the project!
